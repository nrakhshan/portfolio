                <hr class="project">
                <p class="project">LegaSeed is an approximately 1-hour long puzzle game about a group of students searching their 
                    school for treasure. The name is a play on the words legacy and seed, both of which are related to the mystery 
                    the students uncover as they follow the trail of clues leading to the treasure. The game consists of several 
                    dialogue scenes making up the story, as well as mini-games presenting a variety of different puzzles the player 
                    must solve to help the characters follow the clues. 

                    <br><br>The game was created over 2 years during my time as co-president of the Bloor CI Girls Game Development Club (GGDC). 
                    My friend and I founded this club as a way to encourage more girls to learn to code, and provide a comfortable and 
                    inclusive environment to do so. We planned the production of the game in such a way that aside from the dialogue 
                    scenes, the gameplay consisted of mini-games which was each its own self-contained project. 
                    This way, we could come up with puzzle games with varying levels of difficulty in implementation, 
                    and use these projects to teach our members to code. 
                    
                    <br><br>Our entire project was based in an open-source game engine called Godot. Godot has its own language 
                    called GDScript which is similar to Python, with clean and simple syntax, so we thought it would be suitable 
                    for beginners. Additionally, Godot has an intuitive visual interface to aid with managing sprites, so it was easy 
                    for our members to start making simple games right away just by knowing a few basics. We believed teaching coding 
                    using games would help with motivation, as seeing a visual result of your hard work is more rewarding than the 
                    terminal-based projects that most beginners tend to start out with. 
                    
                    <br><br>In my case, it was incredibly rewarding to see my club members grow alongside this project. Although this 
                    project certainly strengthened my technical skills, what I value most is what this experience taught me about 
                    collaboration, communication, and leadership.
                    
                    <br><br>The game is available for download at <a href="https://rupalico.itch.io/legaseed">https://rupalico.itch.io/legaseed</a>.
