                <p class="project">Fall Fugitive is a top-down car-chasing game where the player is inside a police 
                    car in a high-speed chase after some bank robbers. The police car is moving through all 4 lanes and 
                    must dodge the other cars while chasing after the getaway vehicle. Along the way, they must collect bags of stolen 
                    money that were dropped along the way. There is no time limit or destination - the player wins if they 
                    are able to collect 10 bags of money without crashing into any cars (which would result in an immediate loss). There 
                    is no penalty for missing a bag of money. 

                    <br><br>In this partner project, we collaborated on the game logic, but worked separately on the other components 
                    and used GitHub to share our files. My main responsibility was outputting all the components to the VGA. 
                    Using C, it was fairly simple to write different functions to "print" different sprites to the screen, and 
                    randomize positions and colours using function arguments. What I struggled with was implementing hardware-enabled 
                    double buffering, to ensure our game looked smooth and had no tearing. In my initial implementation, some components 
                    disappearing when the processor switched the alternating buffer frames. 
                    
                    <br><br>It took a lot of debugging and rewriting to finally get it right, but in the process I gained a much deeper 
                    understanding of how the processor really worked.
